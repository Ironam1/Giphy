# Giphy

The problem: 

- Dynamically render an arry of Javascript objects as HTML buttons. 
- Make an API call to Giphy and render the results as still images when the user clicks on any button. When the user clicks on an image, the gif will animate. When the user clicks on the image again, the image will return to a still state. 
- I have also included a form that allows the user to render a button of their own creation. This button will also make an API call when clicked.
